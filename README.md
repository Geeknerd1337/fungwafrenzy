# fungwafrenzy
Modern Offline Client for Indie FMV Hit "Fung-Wa Frenzy"

# installation
In the future, installer builds will be offered through the "Releases" tab on the right. In the meantime, you can build and install the project by doing the following:
1. clone the repo
2. ensure npm is configured on your system
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run package`
5. locate the installer in `release/build/Fung-Wa Frenzy Setup x.x.x.exe`
6. double-click the installer

For development purposes, you can run the app using a dev environment with `npm start`. It will live refresh the app when changes are saved.

# impacts
Fung-Wa Frenzy relies on packages named "impacts" to determine what content is played and when that content is played. In this repo I have included a test impact (Impact -1) in `assets/impacts/Impact -1.zip`, but no official impacts are currently being distributed.
